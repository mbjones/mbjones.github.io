My research focuses on environmental informatics, and particularly software for management, integration, analysis, and modeling of heterogeneous environmental data.  Recent projects have produced effective new techniques for information management and analysis, including metadata standards, data management software, and data analysis software such as scientific workflow systems. I co-founded the [KNB Data Repository](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org), a long-term data archive of environmental data sets that uses the [Metacat](http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/metacat) data repository software. I also lead the creation and ratification of the [Ecological Metadata Language](http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml) and contributed to the Biological Data Profile metadata standard.   Recent projects focus on [Kepler](https://kepler-project.org), an open-source scientific workflow system that I co-founded with other researchers; [DataONE](http://dataone.org), a global federation of data repositories aimed to promote access to data about life on earth and the environment; and SemTools, an effort to achieve environmental data interoperability through semantic modeling of scientific observations.
