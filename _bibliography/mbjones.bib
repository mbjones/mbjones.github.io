Cyberinfrastructure Pathways: The Whole Tale" project (NSF award \#1541450). Our
approach has two nested goals: 1) deliver an environment that enables
researchers to create a complete narrative of the research process including
exposure of the data-to-publication lifecycle, and 2) systematically and
persistently link research publications to their associated digital scholarly
objects such as the data, code, and workflows. To enable this, Whole Tale will
create an environment where researchers can collaborate on data, workspaces,
and workflows and then publish them for future adoption or modification.
Published data and applications will be consumed either directly by users using
the Whole Tale environment or can be integrated into existing or future domain

Multidisciplinary scientists and programmers from multiple institutions comprise the core development team. {SEEK} design and development are informed by three multidisciplinary teams of scientists organized in Working Groups. The Biodiversity and Ecological Analysis and Modeling Working Group informs development through evaluation of {SEEK} efficacy in addressing biodiversity and ecological questions. The Knowledge Representation Working Group provides knowledge representation requirements from the domain sciences and develops the corresponding knowledge representations (ontologies) to support the assembly of analytical workflows in the Analysis and Modeling System, and the intelligent data and service discovery in the {EcoGrid}. A Biological Classification and Nomenclature Working Group investigates solutions to mediating among multiple taxonomies for naming organisms. A multifaceted education, outreach and training program ensures that the {SEEK} research products, software, and information technology infrastructure optimally benefit the target communities.},

Finding and integrating relevant data to assist in these analyses is crucial, but is difficult owing to ambiguous terminology and the lack of sufficient information about datasets. Ontologies provide a formal mechanism for defining terms and their relationships, and can improve the location, interpretation and integration of data based on its inherent meaning. Ontologies have assisted other disciplines (e.g. molecular biology) in unifying and enriching descriptions of data, and ecology can benefit from similar approaches. We review ontology efforts in ecology, and describe how these can benefit research by enhancing the location and interpretation of relevant data for confronting crucial ecological questions.},

	abstract = {We assessed the relationship between prior vigor and severity of winter injury to trees and saplings of red spruce (Picearubens Sarg.) at Mount Moosilauke, New Hampshire. Severity of injury was quantified as percent foliar damage on current-year needles after severe injury in the winter of 1988–1989. There was no relationship between severity of injury and prior crown condition. There was only a weak tendency for trees with high live crown ratios to be less damaged than trees with proportionally smaller crowns. Severity of winter injury was not correlated with prior growth rates in the 1-, 2-, or 5-year periods preceding injury, for either trees (radial growth) or saplings (extension growth). However, crown condition of trees and saplings deteriorated significantly following injury. For both trees and saplings, prior growth and subsequent growth were positively correlated for the 1- and 2-year periods before and after the winter injury event. Effects of winter injury on growth in 1989 and 1990 were analyzed using growth ratios (subsequent growth relative to prior growth) to avoid ambiguity resulting from individual differences in growth rates. Severity of winter injury had no effect on growth ratios in the 1- or 2-year periods following winter injury. Although no effects on growth were detected following a single winter injury event, it remains plausible that successive, severe episodes of winter injury could reduce growth and increase mortality risk in red spruce.},

	abstract = {Many scientific disciplines are now data and information driven, and new scientific knowledge is often gained by scientists putting together data analysis and knowledge discovery ‘pipelines’. A related trend is that more and more scientific communities realize the benefits of sharing their data and computational services, and are thus contributing to a distributed data and computational community infrastructure (a.k.a. ‘the Grid’). However, this infrastructure is only a means to an end and ideally scientists should not be too concerned with its existence. The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of whatwe call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve, e.g., database access and querying steps, data analysis and mining steps, and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high-performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects.We then elaborate on Kepler, a particular scientific workflow system, currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects. We describe some key features of Kepler and its underlying Ptolemy {II} system, planned extensions, and areas of future research.Kepler is a community-driven, open source project, andwe always welcome related projects and new contributors to join.},

As the size and complexity of these networks increase, many challenges arise including monitoring and controlling sensor devices, archiving large volumes of continuously generated data, and the management of heterogeneous hardware devices. This paper presents the Kepler Sensor Platform, an open-source, vender neutral extension to a scientific workflow system for full-lifecycle management of sensor networks. This extension addresses many of the challenges that arise from sensor site management by providing a suite of tools for monitoring and controlling deployed sensors, as well as for sensor data analysis, modeling, visualization, documentation, archival, and retrieval. An integrated scheduler interface has been developed allowing users to schedule workflows for periodic execution on remote servers. We discuss and evaluate the scalability of periodically executed sensor archiving workflows that automatically download, document, and archive data from a sensor site. We conclude by discussing and comparing the Kepler Sensor Platform to related software.},

	abstract = {We report the severity and detailed spatial patterns of winter injury to red spruce (Picearubens Sarg.) in the winter of 1988–1989 and assess support for the desiccation and freezing hypotheses. Foliar injury was quantified at three elevations (840, 990, and 1140 m) and on east- and west-facing slopes in the spruce-fir zone at Mount Moosilauke, New Hampshire. Overall, 29\% of current-year foliage on red spruce trees was killed by winter injury. Injury increased with elevation. There was a weak tendency for winter injury to be higher on the sun-exposed south sides of crowns, but substantial injury also occurred on shaded foliage. Injury increased markedly with height in crown at high elevation, but decreased with height at low elevation. The results appear inconsistent with desiccation as the main cause of winter injury. Elevational trends in foliar injury are consistent with the freezing hypothesis, but the strong trends in foliar injury by height within trees cannot be fully explained without further data on spatial variation in microclimate and freezing tolerance. Failure to break bud was assessed on the same spatial scales as foliar injury. Bud break was least in trees and crown sections with severe foliar injury. No evidence for winter injury was found on balsam fir (Abiesbalsamea (L.) Mill.). The results support the hypothesis that winter injury may contribute to the current decline of red spruce in the northern Appalachians.},

	abstract = {With the advent of affordable yet powerful handheld computers, many ecologists now capture data electronically in the field, while avoiding transcription errors found in more traditional field notebook or slate-based approaches of recording data. Ecologists either use simple forms from generic handheld software that doesn’t allow for needed optimizations, or else they must spend substantial effort in the design and optimization of handheld software user interfaces. These efforts often produce highly customized software that is not easily repurposed, and that produce non-standard, undocumented data formats. Our research is focused on reducing this effort by providing a flexible framework that uses highly structured metadata to drive the generation of customized data entry interfaces. Our approach relies on formalized metadata encoded in either {XML} Schema or {XML} instance documents, which facilitate the creation of graphical interfaces from arbitrary data schemas. Specifically, we leverage the rich metadata descriptions and structures found in the Ecological Metadata Language to create data entry forms, and output data sets that adhere to this specification. The interfaces are refined by using data-typing and domain information found in the structured metadata to generate validation routines that assist in maintaining data integrity during the entry process. The framework utilizes a rule-based engine to promote both reuse and extensibility of the modules that are created for any given data entry effort. Interfaces are rendered using open, Internet-based standards to maintain portability and to advocate the sharing of software components. The framework represents an initial implementation of a customizable user interface generator, which should have broad applicability to researchers in need of rapidly creating field and laboratory-based forms for varied collection efforts.},

Furthermore, longitudinal studies across courses and {ABET} accreditation necessitate tracking students throughout their academic programs in which each course will have different types of data. Researchers need to manage, assign metadata to, merge, sort, and query all of these data to support instructional decisions, research and accreditation. To address these needs we have constructed a database to support both data-driven instructional decision making and research in {STEM} education. We have built upon existing metadata standards to define an extensible Educational Metadata Language ({EdML}) that enables assessments to be tagged based on taxonomies, standard psychometrics such as difficulty and discrimination, and other data to facilitate cross-study analyses. Once a collection of assessment data are available, faculty can examine their assessment data to evaluate historical trends, analyze the effectiveness of pedagogical techniques and strategies, or compare the performance of different teaching and assessment techniques within their course or across institutions.},

The relationship between toxicant-induced changes in the feeding behaviour of the cladoceran, Daphnia catawba (Coker), and subsequent effects at population and community levels were experimentally addressed. 2. We adapted a method for measuring the thoracic appendage beat rate of individuals (termed the {TAR} and positively correlated with daphnid feeding rate) after exposure to toxicant at known levels, for use as a behavioural bioassay for low levels of aquatic toxicants. The {TAR} declined significantly with an increase in both sublethal and lethal levels of the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate ({SDS}). 3. We also measured population level effects (i.e. rates of reproduction, survival, and R0), and found that reductions in these values occurred at the same concentrations as the effects on individual behaviour. 4. In most cases, the changes in feeding behaviour occurred more rapidly (less-than-or-equal-to 30 h) than changes in population parameters (days to weeks). 5. We conclude that toxicant-induced changes in individual feeding behaviour can provide a quicker estimate of effects on individuals and of potential community effects (i.e. effects on their prey populations) than measurements of population parameters. In addition, due to its sensitivity at low levels of toxicants, the behavioural bioassay may be particularly helpful in identifying effects of sublethal levels of aquatic pollutants.},

The Knowledge Network for Bioconplexity seeks to address these issues through the use of structured metadata encoded in Extensible Markup Language ({XML}). The main goal of this project has been to design and implement a schema-independent data storage system for {XML} which is called Metacat.

The Kepler scientific workflow system provides domain scientists with an easy-to-use yet powerful system for capturing scientific workflows ({SWFs}). {SWFs} are a formalization of the ad-hoc process that a scientist may go through to get from raw data to publishable results. Kepler attempts to streamline the workflow creation and execution process so that scientists can design, execute, monitor, re-run, and communicate analytical procedures repeatedly with minimal effort. Kepler is unique in that it seamlessly combines high-level workflow design with execution and runtime interaction, access to local and remote data, and local and remote service invocation. {SWFs} are superficially similar to business process workflows but have several challenges not present in the business workflow scenario. For example, they often operate on large, complex and heterogeneous data, can be computationally intensive and produce complex derived data products that may be archived for use in reparameterized runs or other workflows. Moreover, unlike business workflows, {SWFs} are often dataflow-oriented as witnessed by a number of recent academic systems (e.g., {DiscoveryNet}, Taverna and Triana) and commercial systems (Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot, Inforsense). In a sense, {SWFs} are often closer to signal-processing and data streaming applications than they are to control-oriented business workflow applications.},

	abstract = {Ecological and environmental data cover a wide range of topics, from biodiversity surveys to measurements of trace gas fluxes, and are modeled using a tremendous variety of schemas. We have developed Morpho, a data management application designed to assist researchers in managing this heterogeneous collection of ecological data. Our goal in developing Morpho was to ease the burden of data management on scientists while improving access to and documentation for ecological data. Morpho allows ecological researchers to describe their data using a comprehensive and flexible metadata specification, and to share their data publicly or to specific collaborators over the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity ({KNB}). Morpho's main features include: (1) flexible metadata creation and editing using an {XML} syntax for metadata exchange; (2) a 'wizard' interface for collecting metadata; (3) automated metadata extraction while importing data; (4) an {XML} editor that is configurable using multiple {XML} {DTDs}; (5) compliance with the Ecological Metadata Language; (6) powerful metadata search on the network or locally; and, (7) comprehensive revision control for data and metadata.},

	title = {Incorporating Semantics in Scientific Workflow Authoring},
	url = {http://2005.ssdbm.org/SSDBM_2005_Proceedings.pdf.},
	abstract = {The tools used to analyze scientific data are often distinct from those used to archive, retrieve, and query data. A scientific workflow environment, however, allows one to seamlessly combine these functions within the same application. This increase in capability is accompanied by an increase in complexity, especially in workflow tools like Kepler, which target multiple science domains including ecology, geology, oceanography, physics, and biology. To overcome this complexity, we have developed semantically-driven user-interface components that are customized at run-time using domain-specific ontologies. One such subsystem in Kepler uses domain-specific ontologies to customize the presentation of analytical components and data for use by scientists building workflows. Kepler also provides for semantically-enabled queries for components, which can significantly increase efficiency in workflow authoring tasks. In this demonstration, we show how ontologies can be used for user-interface customization and more. In particular, we show our recent ontology-driven extensions for workflow authoring in Kepler. These extensions include our advances in: (1) automating dataintegration and service-composition tasks, (2) the use of semantic annotations to verify that workflows are semantically meaningful, and (3) the ability to search for contextually relevant components and data sets in situ, i.e., as a user is designing a scientific workflow.},

	abstract = {Effective discovery and integration of ecological data within data management systems requires rich semantic information that can describe and relate the types of information contained within disparate data sets. Within the Semtools project, we have developed approaches for expressing and representing semantic annotations of data sets for supplementing attribute and data-level metadata with terms drawn from domain-speciﬁc ontologies. Annotations provide a formal mechanism that can be used together with reasoning systems to enhance existing data discovery and integration approaches. We describe extensions to the Ecological Metadata Language ({EML}) and associated tools for storing and using semantic annotations. Speciﬁcally, we describe new user interface components implemented within the Morpho metadata editor for capturing user-supplied semantic annotations, extensions to the Metacat system for storing and accessing annotations and corresponding {OWL}-{DL} ontologies, and a new {API} within Metacat that uses annotation metadata to provide concept-based search and integration of data sets.},
